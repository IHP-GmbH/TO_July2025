The aim of this project is to design a 5 GHz Transimpedance Amplifier (TIA). The amplifier is intended to operate with commercial UFSDs (Ultra-Fast Silicon Detectors) based on LGAD (Low Gain Avalanche Detector) technology, which are currently used in several Brazilian particle accelerators. The signal will be digitized in later stages of the project.


The project is Self Biased.
