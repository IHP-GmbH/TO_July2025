The aim of this project is the development of a Transimpedance Amplifier (TIA) capable of handling ultra-fast sporadic signals up to 50 GHz, designed to receive signals in the range of microamperes (ÂµA) and spaced at intervals of up to 2 ns. The primary application of this amplifier is in the detection of high-speed particles in particle accelerators, with performance comparable to leading commercial amplifiers.
